Due to GitHub's file size limits, we choose to store the trained model on https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cQVmT3uik298FnZOuZcAMtlaZJPfiID_?usp=drive_link

# Pretrained mode

You should download pretrain model from relevant github repository.

For example, if you want to use [DNABERT-2](https://huggingface.co/zhihan1996/DNABERT-2-117M), you need to put them into the pretrain folder and rename the relevant choice in the model.
